# üß≠ Ethos/GuildQuest Design System

This document outlines the architecture, component philosophy, and implementation plan for the Ethos/GuildQuest platform. It establishes a consistent development path, guiding the design of quests, boards, threads, and post systems through a unified visual and data structure.

---

## üéØ Goal

Create a professional, modular, and extensible system that:

* Uses **boards** as the universal UI layer.
* Treats **posts** as atomic units of interaction.
* Uses **quests** to organize and structure related posts.
* Introduces **threads** for conversations and quest logs.
* Renders structures (trees, lists, grids) based on item relationships.

---

## üìê UI Principles

* Clean and professional appearance (vanilla-friendly, responsive)
* Minimal visual clutter with structure cues (expand icons, indentation)
* Modular board layouts that adapt to content (list, grid, tree, etc.)
* Views shift from overview to deep-dive (e.g., quest map ‚Üí task post)

---

## üß± Component Architecture

### Posts (Atomic Data Units)

* Can be standalone or linked to quests, threads, or other posts.
* Post structures:

  * Flat timeline
  * Reply thread (hashmap + linked list)
  * Activity feed
* Can be rendered as board items.

### Quests (Structured Collections of Posts)

* Rooted in a summary post.
* Contain subtasks, logs, and updates as child posts.
* Visualized as:

  * Tree (QuestTree)
  * List (QuestList)
  * Grid (QuestGrid)
  * Graph (QuestGraph ‚Äî supports cycles)
* Rendered using `QuestBoardMap`.

### Boards (Universal Container)

* Accepts posts, quests, or hybrid items.
* Structure adapts based on:

  * Number of items
  * Item structure preference (tree, list, grid)
* Single-item boards adopt the internal structure of the item.
* Can be filtered and sorted.

### Threads (Conversations)

* Used for chat or discussion.
* Each thread is a structured list or tree of linked posts.
* Default to timeline for quest logs, but toggleable to threaded view.

## üìÅ File Structure & Order of Implementation

### Contexts

1. `AuthContext.js` ‚Äì user, login state, permissions
2. `BoardContext.js` ‚Äì view mode, structure, filters

### Pages

3. `quest/[id].jsx` ‚Äì Full quest view (log + map)
4. `boards/[id].jsx` ‚Äì General board view
5. `post/[id].jsx` ‚Äì Post with thread
6. `new.jsx` ‚Äì Create new post/quest

### Components ‚Äì Quests

1. `QuestBoardMap.jsx`
2. `mapstructure/QuestList.jsx`
3. `mapstructure/QuestTree.jsx`
4. `mapstructure/QuestGrid.jsx`
5. `mapstructure/QuestGraph.jsx`
6. `QuestCard.jsx`
7. `QuestSummaryHeader.jsx`

### Components ‚Äì Board

1. `Board.jsx`
2. `itemstructure/index.js`

---

## üîÅ Board Behavior Logic

* If 1 item on board ‚Üí display that item‚Äôs structure view
* If multiple items ‚Üí use board‚Äôs structure setting (list, grid, scroll)
* If item is a thread ‚Üí show timeline or reply thread depending on context
* Quest boards = boards with post items linked to a quest root post
* Quest logs = threads embedded in quest boards

---

## üß† Interaction Model

| Element | Primary Role                | Interaction Modes       |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Post    | Atomic content/message unit | Reply, Like, Link       |
| Thread  | Grouped discussion/posts    | Timeline, Threaded view |
| Quest   | Collection of linked posts  | Log, Map, Subtasks      |
| Board   | Container of items          | Filters, Layout switch  |

---

## üå± Philosophy

> Boards display items. Items can contain structure. Structure becomes the view.

This approach lets the app scale from social interaction ‚Üí collaborative work ‚Üí deep project tracking without changing the core UX language.

---

## üìå Next Steps

* Begin with `contexts/`&#x20;
* then¬†`pages/`¬†
* then¬†`components/`¬†
* then¬†`backend/`¬†
* start with boards/structuresuest/mapstructures, post/structure component structures
* Build `Board.jsx` to adapt based on item count and structure
* Complete `QuestBoardMap.jsx` to visualize structure from post links
* Replace `PostTimeline` with board-based layout
* Introduce thread-aware rendering for logs and replies

**Prompt: Designing Git Integration and Post Linkage in a Quest-Based Collaboration Platform**

---

**Objective:**
Integrate Git functionality, file structure syncing, post linkage propagation, and markdown-based commit visualization into a quest-based platform (e.g., Ethos/GuildQuest). The platform must support both developers and non-developers (creators, freelancers) while maintaining modularity and open-source compatibility.

---

**System Overview:**

1. **Quest = Project / Repository**

   * Each quest maps to a virtual project folder that may sync with a GitHub or GitLab repository.
   * If a GitHub repo is connected later, the backend listens for commits and updates.

2. **Task Nodes = Folders/Files**

   * Task nodes create real files/folders.
   * Nested nodes = folder structure.
   * Leaf nodes = files.
   * TODO comments in posts become inline TODOs in files.

3. **Posts = Logs / Commits / Instructions**

   * Freeform posts use markdown.
   * Posts linked to task nodes track changes, comments, instructions, or commits.
   * Quest logs and task-specific posts may auto-convert into file edits.

4. **Commits**

   * Each file edit generates a commit.
   * Commits are stored and rendered using markdown:

     ```
     changes: line 42 replaced with ...
     ...
     full file view toggle
     ```
   * Can push/pull from GitHub, fallback to local-only version.

5. **File Syncing and Versioning**

   * Frontend reflects file/folder structure based on the quest map.
   * Backend updates files on structure edits.
   * Git updates are listened to and propagated into post history.

6. **Post Linking and Propagation**

   * Solving a linked post (marked complete) updates others linked to it.
   * Updates cascade through linked requests/tasks.
   * Supports citation, solution similarity, and GitHub issue linking.

7. **Github Integration**

   * Upon login, user can link GitHub account.
   * GitHub repos converted to quests.

     * Issues = posts/quest logs
     * Commits = line/file edits
     * Project board = board layout
   * Forking = crosslinking to other quests
   * Merge PRs = tracking solved states

---

**Frontend Files to Update:**

* **LinkControls.tsx** ‚Äì Allow linking of posts and nodes, track propagation
* **CreatePost.tsx / EditPost.tsx** ‚Äì Add markdown preview, support TODO tracking
* **ContributionCard.tsx / PostCard.tsx** ‚Äì Show commit diffs, line changes
* **GraphLayout.tsx / Board.tsx** ‚Äì Visualize quest map as file tree or graph
* **CreateQuest.tsx / EditQuest.tsx** ‚Äì Enable git repo init, sync controls
* **api/quest.ts / api/post.ts / api/git.ts** ‚Äì Git actions, file change tracking
* **useQuest.ts / usePost.ts / useGit.ts (new)** ‚Äì Hooks for syncing quest-file structure

---

**User Flow Integration:**

1. **User Registers**

   * Optional: Connect GitHub account

2. **User Creates Quest**

   * Initializes a repo/folder structure (option to download locally)
   * Design graph/tree of task nodes (creates folders/files)

3. **User Adds Posts**

   * Can tag lines, suggest TODOs, write logs
   * Markdown rendering
   * TODOs appear in code files

4. **User Commits or Edits**

   * Commits from GitHub or site update quest log
   * Shows line diffs, markdown descriptions

5. **Post Linking**

   * Link duplicate problems/requests
   * When marked solved, related posts update
   * Show influence or citation map (graph)

6. **Git Sync**

   * User pushes from local (or site pushes for them)
   * Pulls updates from GitHub when available
   * Dual remote repo support (GitHub + platform)

---

**Potential Implications:**

* Enables cross-project learning (solution graph)
* Promotes open collaboration (Git-powered wiki/log)
* Educates users through transparent changes
* Frees creators to focus on structure and content, not just code
* Supports advanced devs via Git CLI, beginners via GUI

---

**Future Add-ons:**

* Auto mark task complete when commit changes relevant file
* ChatGPT code assistant per file/task node
* Auto-detect cycles and patterns in graphs
* Visualization of influence & citation chain
* Git diff ‚Üí markdown ‚Üí post converter
* Peer-review workflows via post comments + review labels
